	I got my driver's license last week
	<p>
Just like we always talked about
<p>
'Cause you were so excited for me
<p>
To finally drive up to your house
<p>
But today I drove through the suburbs
<p>
Crying 'cause you weren't around
<p>
And you're probably with that blonde girl
<p>
Who always made me doubt
<p>
She's so much older than me
<p>
She's everything I'm insecure about
<p>
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
<p>
'Cause <a href="narrative2/index.html"> how could I ever love someone else?</a>
<p>
And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
<p>
And I just can't imagine <a href="narrative1/index.html">how you could be so okay</a> now that I'm gone
<p>
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
<p>
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
<p>
And all my friends are tired
<p>
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
<p>
I kinda feel sorry for them
<p>
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah
<p>
Today I drove through the suburbs
<p>
And pictured I was driving home to you
<p>
And I know <a href="narrative3/index.html">we weren't perfect</a>
<p>
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
<p>
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
<p>
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
<p>
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
<p>
Red lights, stop signs
<p>
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
<p>
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
<p>
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe 
<p>
<a href="narrative4/index.html"> Sidewalks we crossed </a>
<p>
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
<p>
Over all the noise
<p>
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
<p>
But I still fuckin' love you, babe 
<p>
I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
<p>
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
<p>
'Cause you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
<p>
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
<p>
Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street </p>
