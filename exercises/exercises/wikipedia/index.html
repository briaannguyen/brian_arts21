Her song "So High" caught the attention of Kemosabe and RCA Records where she signed a joint record deal at the age of 17, subsequently releasing her debut EP Purrr! in 2014. </p>

		<p> After a commercial hiatus, Doja Cat released her debut studio album, Amala (2018), to commercial failure, but later earned viral success as an internet meme with the single "Mooo!", which appeared on the deluxe version of her debut album along with singles "Juicy" and "Tia Tamera" in 2019. Doja Cat's second studio album, Hot Pink (2019), reached the top 10 of the US Billboard 200 and spawned the single "Say So", which topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart following the release of two remixes featuring Nicki Minaj. </p>

				Early Life </div>
		<div class= "body">
	
		<p> Amala Ratna Zandile Dlamini was born on October 21, 1995, into an artistic family in Los Angeles, California in the neighborhood of Tarzana. Her mother, Deborah Elizabeth Sawyer, is a Jewish-American painter. Her father, Dumisani Dlamini, is a South African actor, composer and film producer of Zulu ethnicity best known for starring in the 1992 musical film Sarafina! According to Doja Cat, she never met her father growing up. Her father has denied this claim, stating that he has a "healthy" relationship with his daughter. </p>

		<p> Soon after her birth, Dlamini and her mother moved to New York City, where they lived for five years. Her family later moved back to California in Oak Park, where her mother enrolled her in ballet, tap and jazz lessons as a child. Her family then moved to the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles when she was 11 years old, where they lived in an ashram and practiced Hinduism for four years. She claims that she lacked interest in school from then on, instead taking a liking for dance. After having taken breakdancing classes, she joined a professional poplocking troupe with whom she competed in dance battles throughout Los Angeles while still attending high school. She also frequently skipped school to participate in online chatrooms. She eventually dropped out of high school at age 16 while in her junior year. </p>

	Career </div>
		<div class= "header"> 2012–2017: Career beginnings and record deal </div>
		<div class= "body"> 

		<p> Doja Cat has described life after dropping out of high school as "messy", claiming that she slept on the floor and spent "all night and day" browsing the internet, looking for beats and instrumentals from YouTube which she downloaded and used to create her own music. She taught herself to sing, rap and use GarageBand while at home without a job, frequently making music and uploading it to SoundCloud. She got her stage name from one of her cats as well as her favorite strain of marijuana, stating, "I was heavily addicted to weed and weed culture, so when I began rapping I thought of the word 'doja' and how it sounds like a girl's name." Doja Cat's formative years involved a brief stint uploading makeup tutorials onto YouTube and, later on, releasing SoundCloud bedroom recordings that eventually attracted the attention of record labels. In late 2012, her song "So High", became the first permanent upload on her SoundCloud account, and soon caught the attention of Kemosabe Records and RCA Records where she signed at age 17. This deal also came with a temporary artist management partnership with Roc Nation. In August 2014, Doja Cat released her debut EP, Purrr!, described as "spacey, eastern-influenced R&B" by The Fader. "So High" was repackaged and released as her solo commercial debut single prior to the EP's release, and was later featured on the Fox series Empire in the third episode of the show's first season. In mid-2015, Doja Cat signed to OG Maco's label, OGG. Following the signing, in late 2016, Maco and Doja Cat collaborated on the song "Monster", from Maco's 2017 mixtape, Children of The Rage. </div> </p> 

		<div class="header"> 2018–2019: Amala and "Mooo!" </div>
		<div class= "body"> 
		<p> In February 2018, Doja Cat released the promotional single "Roll with Us". The following month, she released the single, "Go to Town", which was released with an accompanying music video on the same day and would become the lead single from her debut album. "Candy" was released as the album's second single that same month. The track would become a sleeper hit after a "dance challenge" on the video-sharing platform TikTok went viral in late 2019. Consequently, the single charted in countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States, the latter having the song peak at 86 on the Billboard Hot 100 making it her first solo entry on the chart. On March 30, 2018, her debut studio album Amala was released, including the three singles. She later claimed to have been under the influence of marijuana for most of the production of the album. NPR described the album as a "manifesto of a young woman striving to take ownership of her craft, her image and her sexuality, mixing genres like dancehall, trap, house and R&B with a healthy dose of sass and humor." At the time of its release, the album was largely ignored by critics and failed to chart in any market. The album would later peak at number 138 on the Billboard 200 in late 2019. </p>

		<p> In August 2018, Doja Cat uploaded the completely self-produced music video for her song "Mooo!", a novelty song with absurdist lyrics where she fantasizes about being a cow, on YouTube. The video garnered attention and viral success as a meme. Due to popular demand following the music video's viral success, she released a single version of "Mooo!" later that month. In February 2019, she released the single and accompanying video for "Tia Tamera" featuring Rico Nasty, which preceded the release of a deluxe edition of Amala. </p>

		<p> The re-release of the album included three new songs, including "Mooo!" and "Juicy". A remix of "Juicy" featuring Tyga and its accompanying music video were released in August 2019. Following the release of the remix, the song debuted at number 83 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking Doja Cat's first entry on the chart, and ultimately peaked at number 41. The song would eventually be certified Platinum in the United States.[42] It led to Amala debuting for the first time on the Billboard 200 album chart in August as well. </div> </p>

			<p> In October 2019, Doja Cat released "Bottom Bitch", the lead single from her second album.

			Influences
		</div>
		<div class="body">
			Doja Cat's voracious cultural tastes draw from her background engaging in online activities as a suburban teenager. Like many in her generation, she spent much of her time in front of a computer, delving into sub-cultures and browsing through information about various topics. Her formative years involved a brief stint uploading makeup tutorials onto YouTube and, later on, releasing SoundCloud bedroom recordings. Doja Cat has cited American singer D'Angelo and Barbadian singer Rihanna among her biggest influences. She has also stated American singer Beyoncé "is one of the driving forces of who I am in my career." Doja Cat explained that the R&B music her mother used to play in her house "poured into [her] childhood," ranging from Earth, Wind & Fire to Black Eyed Peas, and described her music as "a sponge soaking up water," stating: "I really pull from everyone. I'm absorbent... if I hear a beat Busta Rhymes would absolutely kill, I'll use my voice to do a flow similar to his."" During her early career, Doja Cat cited Japanese culture as an inspiration. She has also cited rapper Nicki Minaj as an influence with XXL writer Stacy-Ann Ellis noticing "their similar cartoonish rap deliveries and whimsical sartorial selects."

			Musical style and themes
		</div>
		<div class= "body">
			<p> Doja Cat has been noted for her musical versatility, including genre fluidity for "crossover-ready pop songs" and her ability to sing, rap and produce. When asked about her legacy, she revealed that in future she would like to be remembered for her versatility in not only music but also visual art and dance. Despite being described as a quirky, outlandish "internet rapper," Doja Cat approached her artistic craft just as seriously as any other burgeoning artist. Her second full-length studio album, Hot Pink, is built with her own beats as well as a series of videos written and conceived by herself. Doja called Hot Pink a firm restart for her career, and the most "refined, chiseled" representation of herself. Her escapist fantasy worldview is reflected with the music by its upbeat production style. The record was inspired by some drastic lifestyle changes, and sees Doja Cat finally "coming into [her] own" and embracing her strengths as an artist. </p>

			<p> Lyrically, Doja Cat is a type of "unapologetically and aggressively sexual" figure. She is able to cleverly combine dick jokes with niche references to celebrity gossip and name-checkings in a rapid-fire, stream-of-consciousness manner. As demonstrated by an abundant usage of salacious double-entendres and declaratives in addition to frequent pop-culture references, Doja Cat's second album Hot Pink is a witty, irreverent, transgressive encapsulation of her abilities. According to Doja Cat, "There are people who rap in a certain way, because they want to do something so elaborate and so smart that makes you go, 'Oh my God, I would've never thought of that. But I'd rather be the other end of that, which is being ignorant and stupid and saying whatever I want. ... Or just being, like, 'I don't want to think too hard today.'" Doja Cat expresses a laid-back irreverence that contrasts with the wider world's doomful, gloomy outlook which seems to appeal to much of her audience. She provides brief glimpses into an escapist fantasy world, one preoccupied with memes, outrageous appearances and lustful musings. It is reflected within her music by the candid nature of her light-hearted, sexual lyrics. For Doja Cat, her approach to writing overrides any conceptual motives that others may connect to her work. She stated, "I try not to be political... I'm more like, 'I don't give a fuck, I never think about what I write. I just write whatever the first thing that comes to my mind is." Doja Cat maintains that an artist's intention is just as relevant as any external interpretation, saying, "Like, I just love romance and sex ... because there's nothing '-ist' about what I do." </p>

    	<div class="body"> Doja Cat has stated that she "like[s] both [men and women]. I like dicks and I also like, um, I like people that I can have sex with. You can kind of have sex with anybody, right?" In 2019, she began dating indie rock musician Jawny, although the pair split up in February 2020. </div>

    	<p> Doja Cat is a skilled internet troll and known for making playfully absurd posts on platforms such as TikTok. Alongside her eccentric sense of humor and rebellious attitude, Doja Cat is known for her love of "making dumb shit on the internet." However, her posting habits appear to decline with the rise of Doja's mainstream success and she looked to be taken more seriously as an artist. She admits to not being on Twitter as much, even though her brand and career were, in part, launched on the platform with the viral #MooChallenge. More recently, Doja Cat tries to avoid anything that would cross a line and refrain from commenting on other cultural trends, adopting a tone and spirit that is less akin to 4chan. She instead primarily uses Twitter to discover "memes and shitpost and say something funny to my boyfriend" and apparently, perform routine clean-ups of less recent tweets. Doja Cat has become far more active on Instagram, using the platform for displaying colorful video clips and images. Though she keeps to herself most of the time, Doja Cat confesses she will still on occasion roll her eyes online at the "woke hip-hop people" whom she once tweeted that she likes to "disappoint." According to Doja Cat, "It's me being a punk. I love being a punk to people who take things way too seriously." Although she does reassert admiring some of these artists and their work. </p>

		<p> In a July interview with Capital Xtra's breakfast program, she revealed that she was diagnosed with COVID-19 but has since recovered after a "four-day symptom freak out". In an interview with Noisey, when asked to pick between Donald Trump, Kanye West, and Bernie Sanders, Doja Cat picked Bernie Sanders.</div> </p>

    	Controversies
    </div>
    	<div class = "body"> 

    	<p> After achieving viral recognition in 2018 with "Mooo!", Doja Cat sparked controversy on social media when her Twitter account history revealed the usage of homophobic slurs. In a tweet dating back to 2015, Doja Cat used the word "faggot" to describe hip hop artists Tyler, the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt, members of the musical collective Odd Future. Doja Cat initially defended her past remarks. She stated, "I called a couple people faggots when I was in high school in 2015 does this mean I don't deserve support? I've said faggot roughly like 15 thousand times in my life. Does saying faggot mean you hate gay people? I don't think I hate gay people. Gay is ok." Her response was met by even more backlash, including a critical tweet from Will and Grace actress Debra Messing. In her statement, Messing expressed disappointment with Doja for defending her past ignorance and implored her to use her fame and platform for good. Later that day, Doja Cat issued a series of apologies for her derogatory words and has since deleted her tweets. The controversy generated much discourse regarding the limits of "cancel culture," the growing trend of outcry on social media resulting in celebrities being deserted and careers abruptly derailed following publicized past misconduct. As a result of the controversy, Doja Cat was declared the Milkshake Duck of 2018 by NME. </p>

		<p> In March 2020, Doja Cat received backlash after claiming on Instagram live that COVID-19 was only a "flu" and that she was not scared of it. Later that October, Doja Cat was criticized along with other celebrities including Justin Bieber, Travis Scott and Paris Hilton, among others, for participating in Kendall Jenner's Halloween and birthday celebrations during the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

		<p> In May 2020, a 2015 song by Doja Cat titled "Dindu Nuffin" resurfaced. "Dindu Nuffin" is an alt-right term used to ridicule African-American victims of police brutality who claim they are innocent. After apologizing, Doja Cat claimed while though the song was intended to flip the term's meaning, it was a "bad decision". Doja Cat denied she harbored self-hatred and internalized racism or that the song was a response to the death of Sandra Bland, calling the latter allegation "one of the most awful rumors that I've ever encountered." Doja took to Instagram to address her multiple accusations and past actions after footage began circulating of her on Tiny Chat in a chat room saying "nigger" and making sexual comments to men reportedly members of the alt-right/incel community. While she apologized to those offended and said she shouldn't have been on certain chat room sites, Doja Cat maintained she had never personally been involved in any racist conversations. American rapper Nas referenced the controversy in his 2020 single "Ultra Black", with the lyrics "We goin' ultra black / Unapologetically black / The opposite of Doja Cat." Seemingly unfazed, Doja Cat responded on TikTok by sarcastically saying, "I am so offended by this song. Have you guys heard 'Fruit Salad' by The Wiggles?" During an interview with NME, Nas addressed the situation, explaining the attention it received was symptomatic of the social media age. Distractify reported that frequent users of the chatroom came forth and revealed the nature of the chatroom was not specifically racist, and Doja herself didn't say anything discriminatory in her conversations. </div> </p>
