Jack: Please trust me when I say I never meant to hurt you, but maybe I should have just left things be. If you want to let go for good, then I’ll miss you a lot. I hope there’s a point where we can interact again if there’s an opportunity. You really are an amazing person and I mean that wholeheartedly. For now, I’ll respect your boundaries. <p>

You: i don’t really have much to say to this and that’s not because i’m upset or mad or anything but i just truly don’t have anything left to say. I think we’ve let things run its course and at this point it’s just time to go on our own ways. I don’t want to cut you completely out of my life because I know I’ll regret it and I do love spending time with you but right now, i just don’t really trust you anymore and can’t see myself letting you back into my life. <a href= "wnrs2/index.html"> you did a lot of damage</a> and i just think it’s best if i just move on to other things <a href="../ending/index.html"> for now </a><p>
