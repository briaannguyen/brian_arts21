Last night, I broke down and felt isolated in the little crack between home and where I was at. I was just sitting outside on the porch of my friends house balling, but only like opening the lid of my bottle so that a spritz of carbonated liquid rushes out while the rests settles and stays inside. During that time on the warm night I looked at the street and thought of walking to you, but you weren’t there. And my isolation immersed myself itself in the struggle to hold on for just one more day because then you’d be back. I went inside after feeling the cold payment on my feet and burrowed into myself under a thick blanket and cried in the disclosure. Then I remembered what would help your company and turned on my phone.</p>

<p> I opened Spotify and played your playlists while holding my phone on the third lowest volume, loud enough for only me to hear. A few songs later as I was drifting off to a slumber in your memory, Pink Moon played. I woke up sharply, but in a content and warm as a small smile creeped onto my face with a toasty beat in my heart. I remembered that one weekend during the spring where you told me Pink Moon always cheered you up and I spent that whole weekend listening to that playlist and familiarizing myself with the songs so <a href= "text2/index.html">I could cheer up. </a></p>
