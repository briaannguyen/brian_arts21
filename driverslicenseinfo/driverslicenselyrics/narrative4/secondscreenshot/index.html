	I read something the other day that said "the universe in which we never crossed paths must be a kinder one than the universe where we make the effort to love each other and fail" and i guess that could be true for some of the people in my life who have come nad gone, but its never really been true for you. i know things didn't really work out the way we both wanted them too but i don't regret any of it. <a href="../gentleearth/index.html"> thank you for loving me, especially when i couldn't love myself. </a> i know its been years since we've talked and maybe you think i've changed and forgotten about you but i know i'll always love you. <a href="../../narrative3/ending/index.html"> wishing you nothing but the happiest of lives.</a>
