         <p>Check out the full exercise <u><a href = https://briaannguyen.github.io/brian_arts21/exercises/jquery/> here</a></u>.</p>

         <p>This was a fun exercise! Using the JS libraries were less complicated than I thought and I was able to create something that I think held a pretty common thread with my other projects. I noticed that with this project and some of my other ones, I really enjoyed using color as a huge motif. In this project, these different buttons would correlate with gradients that corresponded with different times of the day.</p>
