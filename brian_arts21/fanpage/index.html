         <p>Project 3: Fan Page</a></u></p>
         <div class=introtext>
         <p>A fan page dedicated to the Pride of Broken Arrow, America's premiere marching band.</p>

         <p>Check out the full project <u><a href = https://briaannguyen.github.io/brian_arts21/projects/fanpage/index.html> here</a></u>.</p>

         <p>This project was initially hard for me to come up with a tangible design concept. My first iteration of the project was actually about Frank Ocean since I'm really inspired by his music and his artistry but to be honest, it was really hard curating and conceptualizing a design identity for an artist who already had such strong branding.</p>

         <p> Thus, I switched to the Pride of Broken Arrow. The Pride is one of the top marching bands in America. As someone who grew up classically trained and heavily involved in marching band and wind ensemble, this felt like an appropiate subject to dedicate a fan page to. Let me tell you, I was obsessed with the Pride. Their shows go beyond what someone might think a marching band show is like. It is a full production with quality drill, top student players, full-on design and branding from the marching uniforms to the extra background props to even the sound design used within the production. Wes Cartwright is the Pride's designer (or art director you could say) and his work is revolutionary. It's his mind that makes all of the Pride's shows so captivating and so fun to watch.</p>

         <p>As a multimedia project, I used a variety of different forms to showcase my passion and enthusiasm for the organization. Allowing the user to navigate themselves into the world of Broken Arrow, I explored three of my favorite BA shows and further elaborated the shows by curating 8 different tabs for each show that delved into my favorite parts of that show whether it was from a journal entry from when I first saw the show, to my favorite musical moments, to my favorite drill (where musicians move on the field to create forms) moments, to even videos of me reacting to the shows after a few years.

         <p>My favorite part of the project was being able to create this exciting image of Broken Arrow. You typically don't think of marching band as something exciting or revolutionary but I took heavy inspiration from Nike, fashion culture, and hype culture and wanted to represent these amazing musicians in an exciting, invigorating way that made them seem like superstars or celebrities. For each show, I created a variety of graphics and poster assets that could exist in a world where marching band students were celebrities.</p>

         <p>The fan page went through many design iterations. Even though I had this idea of hype culture and something that was reflective of excitement and empowerment, I was prompted to think critically about the design. I soon came to the problems of fitting my content into a design rather than fitting the design to the content appropiately which is a problem I've come across several times in my other design classes. It's hard! How do you create a design system that is appropiate for the content you are working with rather than the other way around? To be honest, I'm not sure if my current design system for the fan page solved that issue (in some ways, I think I just reverted back to my first project where I took an agnostic approach to the design system) but it is something I definitely still think about and something I want to get better at. That is, after all, a huge part of being a designer. All in all though, I had a lot of fun with this project. It was a huge journey from Frank Ocean to where it is now with Broken Arrow.</p>

         <p> Oh yeah, I also have no idea how I got the grids and flexbox to cooperate so well this project. I still hate it.</p>
