         <p>Typography exploration of Doja Cat and her iconic self (simple and fun versions included).</p>

         <p>Check out the full exercise <u><a href=https://briaannguyen.github.io/brian_arts21/exercises/wikipedia//> here</a></u>.</p>

         <p>Doja Cat is one of my favorite artists and I think she has such a vibrant personality that I think is iconic. I wanted to use typography as a way to embrace her personality and some of the things she has said by enlargening the text, using different typefaces to represent different meanings, and just conceptualizing ways to represent personality. To be honest, I don't think it was a good idea enlargening some of the text even though the thought was there. It created this uneven look to the line spacings and overall, disturbed the hierarchy that could've should've been managed more carefully.</p>
