         <p>We were prompted to create a mobile application or a website that could help an audience bigger than ourselves. It was a pretty daunting task but it was an important project in which it taught us how to navigate user experience and user research, biases in design, and how to culminate a full design project from concepting and research to an ending presentation with all of our documentation and possible brand extensions.</p>

         <p>When I thought of this app, I thought back to my previous projects and what types of content I loved curating. For me, I loved projects and subjects that dealt with emotions and human connection. I was inspired by several sources such as Instagram "happiness graphics" accounts that dealt with self-love, positivity, and personal stories. Thus, I concepted the idea of the Collective, an app meant to connect human beings to other human beings through experiences, memories, stories, and recollections.</p>

         <p>This idea and app went through many iterations. At first, it focused on a map system that would allow people to view other memories and stories through the venue of locations. Then the app started veering into design systems and ideas that reflected various sources of inspiration such as cinematic typography to the feelings of books to a stark B/W sans serif font and feel. The idea itself was pretty abstract and I realized midway through the project that it needed a lot of refining and concrete planning to bring about this already unclear idea.</p>

         <p>Through user interviews, I was able to narrow down the content to something that was more tangible and something I felt more appropiate and aligning to what I wanted. My sister mentioned perspectives through curated events and memories that I thought was curious. She explained how during 9/11, there were several perspectives that existed for that one event. She was 10 years old. Her husband was 14. His mom was in her 30s. Everyone had differing perspectives and experiences yet they all experienced that one single event and memory. How could this all be represented in an app format?</p>

         <p>Thus, I conceptualized the app fundamentals. Users would be given a curated prompt every single day where they would then be able to input their response to that question whether that's through text, audio, a picture, or location. These answers and entries would all be culminated in a single journal entry where users can view other users' answers in this editorial format that functions like a long chapter. 365 days means there are 365 stories and chapters. Something important that I took away from my user interviews was that individuals wanted to feel like they were a part of something. Thus, I came up with this branding concept of every individual and their entries being a part of something bigger. After all, we want to fit into a community. This is how the Collective was born.

         <p>To be honest, this app had a lot of critiques that I thought were super valid. Looking at the app now, I do feel as if some ideas are still unclear and the idea itself is still pretty abstract and not as accessible or useful to some communities as a whole. It felt more like a romanticized app but not anything that would have real purpose in a world full of biases and other problems.</p>
         
         <p>Several critiques of the app dealt with the accessibility of the interface itself. The type was too small, some prototyping decisions felt unclear. The presentation itself also needed more practice and coherence (which I felt was a common thread across this whole project duration). This project showcased how important presentation and coherence mattered. If you can't present your work properly, nothing will matter at that point.</p>

         <p>Strong points, however, came across with the branding extensions with the project (which happened to be my favorite part of the project as well). Thinking about where this could exist within the world was very exciting and allowed me to think experientially (which is a facet of design I would love to engage with more). All in all, this app was critical in developing as a designer and I appreciated all the feedback and lessons I learned from it!</p>
