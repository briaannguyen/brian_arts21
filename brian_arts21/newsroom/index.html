         <p><u>Project 2: Newsroom</u></p>
         <div class=introtext>
         <p>Based on Olivia Rodrigo's <i>Driver's License</i>, Newsroom abstracts the song into an exploration of how complicated and inevitable heartbreak is.</p>

         <p>I would say out of all my projects from all my design studios this semester, this is the one I'm most proud of. It was a vague prompt to start off with but I knew as soon as it was going to deal with heartbreak, it was going to become something complicated to work with. To me, this was less of a design project and more of a storytelling, content curation project.</p>

         This project stemmed off of Olivia Rodrigo's new single which topped the Top 40 charts at the beginning of the year. It became a sensation. But I wanted to go beyond the song itself and tap into the heartbreak that is so embedded within this song. For this project, I asked several of my friends questions that prompted their experiences with heartbreak and used the song lyrics as an avenue to explore these different stories. Hearing my friends retell these stories, their feelings, and experiences was heartwrenching, beautiful, and uncomfortable at points. Some of my friends said no to the project. Some of my friends were uncomfortable. Some of my friends were open books. I think that comes to show how complicated heartbreak and pain is. The lyrics act as a starting off point but beyond the lyrics, it is a story for the user to travel through themselves. Narratives will connect to other narratives, some narratives will end early, some will go beyond. Inevitably, however, they all end at the same page because like in real life, love sometimes stops when you don't expect it to.</p>

         I used a variety of mixed media including pages that just had text on them, audio recordings from friends, other projects and websites about love (the Unsent project, Gentle Earth), pictures of text messages, images from We're Not Really Strangers, a curated card game, songs from Spotify, music videos and more.

         <p> The design language was practically nonexistent yet it fully existed. I used no CSS because I felt as if the text appearing in their natural form (Times New Roman) added to the editorial, raw-like content. It felt right. I wanted the content to speak for itself rather than using extraneous details to get my point across.</p>

         <p> Final takeaways. I am proud of this project. Sometimes I go back through this project and it honestly makes me pretty emotional. I think from this point on is when I realized that as a designer, the most important thing I can do is tell a story. That's essentially what design is. I've used the material and content of this project in so many other design projects. I was inspired by a quote from this project that was shown to us at the beginning of the semester that dealt with love. "Like in real life, love sometimes stops when you don't expect it to." It is very true.</p>
