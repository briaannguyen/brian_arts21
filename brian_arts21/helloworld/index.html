         <p>This was a fun, easy intro to the class. This was recently after my photoshoot which I art directed for my dance company and it was at a time when I started feeling comfortable and confident in the stuff I was putting out into the world as a designer. I really enjoyed art direction and I think during this point of my life (which is crazy to think was only a few months ago), I realized that I wanted to work with photography and videography along with graphic design. I also started to get a sense of the things that influenced my design styles (Nike, hype culture, fashion culture). To me, I found no better way of giving an introduction than me and my best friends doing what we love the most which is dancing. In my world, it's always time to Funk. Oh yeah and this is where I learned how to make a .GIF which I basically went crazy with after this project. Before, I would be using third party websites. </p>
