         <p>Exercise 5: CSS Animation</a></u></p>
         <div class=introtext>
         <p>Pastel gradients and illuminating squares dancing.</p>

         <p>Check out the full exercise <u><a href = https://briaannguyen.github.io/brian_arts21/exercises/animation/index.html> here</a></u>.</p>

         <p>I really enjoyed this exercise! I think I found inspiration from finding this animation of a galaxy and a sun and I wanted to recreate an abstract interpretation of moving and dancing shapes. I just messed around with the gradients until I came up with something that I enjoyed. Everything feels very light and balanced here. I'm quite proud of how this turned out! CSS Animations are some of my favorite things to play around with.</p>
