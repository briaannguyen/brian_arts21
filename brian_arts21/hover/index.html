         <div class=introtext>
         <p>Day in my life. Screenshots and selfies included.</p>

         <p>Check out the full exercise <u><a href = https://briaannguyen.github.io/brian_arts21/exercises/hover/> here</a></u>.</p>

         <p>This was a fun recollection of my day which I think was a huge rehearsal day! I had some troubles with the placements of the pictures (using absolute, relative, and I think the general flexbox and grid structure) but it wasn't too bad.</p>
