         <p>Exercise 4: Flexbox</a></u></p>
         <div class=introtext>
         <p>A simple poster using Flexbox.</p>

         <p>Check out the full exercise <u><a href = https://briaannguyen.github.io/brian_arts21/exercises/flexbox/index.html> here</a></u>.</p>

         <p>I'm not even going to explain this exercise. I had and still have so much trouble using flexbox and grids and this exercise was the bane of my existence. Bye. I made a simple poster. This is also where I discovered that I never actually knew how to input custom fonts and all of my previous exercises did not have any of my custom fonts. I hate flexbox.</p>
