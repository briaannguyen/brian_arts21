            <p>Hi there! My name's Brian Nguyen. Welcome to my web design journal! I'm currently a Design major who's interested in graphic design and art direction but I took this class to expand my design skills and get out of my comfort zone.</p>

            <p>Even though I have no desire to be a web designer or coder by any means, this has been the class that I've learned the most from thanks to Nika who has been an amazing mentor and professor this whole semester. I'm not going to lie, I've spent many nights staying up until the morning, frustrated (I'm looking at you ugly flexbox) trying to finish projects and exercises for this class but in my opinion, it's all been worth it. Let me preface all of this by saying I am horrible at coding. Like completely horrible and I also have horrible time management skills but I've learned so many skills from this class and I appreciate how this class is not just a web design class. In fact, I'd go as far to say that it's not a web design class at all but rather a critical design class through the lens of the web (literally the art of the web). Beyond HTML & CSS, I learned how to improve my typography skills, branding skills, how to prototype and use Figma to its fullest extent, how to curate written content, and most importantly, how to tell a story through a visual narrative which is essentially the most important skill a designer can learn.</p>

            <p>Beyond these tangible skills, this class has just allowed me to tap into my favorite subjects which I think always helps a designer flourish. My favorite project out of all my projects from all my design classes has to be the Newsroom project. Because of this class, I've learned what styles I tend to gravitate towards (Helvetica and colorful gradients let's go) and what content I love developing in my projects (typically emotional and more "meaningful" subjects). I've learned how to be vulnerable in the content I develop and be critical in what I'm putting out to the world.</p>

            <p>To all who is viewing this portfolio page, I hope you get a good sense of who I am as a designer through these projects. I've loved every second of this class and I hope that one day, I'll be able to look back at this website and reminisce.</p>
