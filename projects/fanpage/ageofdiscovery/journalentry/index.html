    <h1>JOURNAL ENTRY #1</h1>

    <p>By far the best opener I've ever heard in marching band history. Age of Discovery was a revolutionary show in so many ways that marching bands like Carmel, Avon, and Blue Springs will never be able to rival The Pride and Wes Cartwright's mastermind. The Space Odyssey with the strong brass powerhouse that Broken Arrow holds and being able to hear it live in person was the best moment of my marching band career in high school. The iconic karts that came out during this year basically redefined what props meant in marching band and put Broken Arrow on a whole new level. These kids not only learned how to ride these karts in sync but they also learned how to play an instrument with one hand while also pedaling the kart WITH someone on top of it. The amount of respect I had for these kids after seeing the performance live for the first time after their Invitational was beyond comprehension. I remember seeing the <u><a href="https://youtu.be/1f2CaH31LVg?t=32">Jenks versus BA football game on YouTube</a></u> and being completely stunned by the Space Odyssey. It just got better. Then it continually got better as the Pride <u><a href="https://youtu.be/J1KFm3rYOX0?t=246">went to Pasadena for the Rose Bowl Festival</a></u> and got new uniforms. They are the holy grail of marching bands in my opinion and I am proud to lose to them every single year (to be honest though, we never really came close).</p>
