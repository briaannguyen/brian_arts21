    <h1>JOURNAL ENTRY #2</h1>

    <p>A year after high school and I still loved The Pride of Broken Arrow. The controversy of their gowns hiding their marching feet really stirred something in everyone else but I knew even then that Broken Arrow had the cleanest feet of all the marchers at Lucas Oil Stadium. Also that American Salute throughout the whole first half was truly iconic. I was hooked on this Martin Gould arrangement for so long. You know, there are some moments where music truly leaves goosebumps on you and I'm embarrassed and not embarrassed to say that this whole show did it whether it was from the chilling pre-opener to the monumental opener to the cheesy closer. These kids continue to amaze me year by year with how hard-working they are and I will always remember why I'm a Broken Arrow stan over any marching band any day.</p>
