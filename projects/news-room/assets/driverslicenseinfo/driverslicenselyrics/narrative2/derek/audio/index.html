    <p>I think the first person I ever fell in love with was named Derek. Um and I think it's one of those moments in time where opposites really do attract. Um, we were so different in our sense of humor and what we liked to do and our personalities and what we enjoyed and what we liked that I wanted to be closer to him and I wanted to learn more about how he views the world and why he is the way he is and what makes us click and what makes us different. </p>
