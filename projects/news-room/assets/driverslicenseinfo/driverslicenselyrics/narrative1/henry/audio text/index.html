    <p>My first love’s name was Henry. We started off as friends as young love does. I actually fell in love with him as he showed me peace, comfort, and happiness. <a href="../../../narrative4/secondscreenshot/index.html"> He really allowed me to realize that the world wasn’t always such a horrible place </a> and I think I had that perception because growing up with my parents, I always saw them fighting and that became my perception of what companionship was. But whenever I was with him, we would just laugh. You know, have stimulating conversations and I started to feel a little tingle in my tummy. It was like a little electric butterfly and I would just crave and crave and crave it. He made playlists for me to help me sleep. He laughed at my jokes when no one else understood them. And he complimented the things that I didn’t like about myself like I just felt completely <a href="selfcontrol/index.html"> at home</a> with him.</p>
