You're dressing like a Sunday morning
<p>
And your eyes look like, little islands in the light
<p>
Hazel and light green
<p>
On white sheets
<p>
You're grinning like a Friday night
<p>
And you're smiling like
<p>
You know what you like, I think I do know you well
<p>
I know you well
<p>
We come alive in the evening
<p>
With heat and wet skin
<p>
And our bodies are tossed
<p>
And turned, tangled up in it
<p>
I come alive when you tease me
<p>
With heat and wet skin
<p>
Flesh and bone turned
<p>
Flesh and bone turned
<p>
<a href="../ending/index.html">The weight of you close to me </a> </p>
