hahaha that’s hard. i haven’t thought about him in a really long time. it was horrible. things had been going wrong for so many months but we kept on holding on until there was nothing left at the end. and when it did end, it was the worst pain i’ve ever felt haha. i remember crying every night for weeks listening to the <a href="../../../skin/index.html"> same song </a> over and over. he was an amazing guy though (well still is i guess). he had the biggest heart and was so kind to everyone, had the most beautiful mind, and was just such a talented guy. he would sing me song covers hahaha. i did learn a lot though. i learned that sometimes it’s just not meant to be and <a href="../../../tiktok/index.html"> you have to let things go </a>. everyone goes through different experiences, different feelings, and different things at a time and so i try not to be so hard on myself and others about it. it clearly wasn’t meant to be and <a href=" ../../../ending/index.html"> even though what we had was beautiful, i had to let it go </a>. i think he’s dating someone new now too so i’m happy for him haha
